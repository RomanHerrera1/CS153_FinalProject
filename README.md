# CS153_FinalProject
<p>Our group for CS153 wanted to classify artificial animals by retraining the Google Inception v3 with a new dataset created for both artificial cats and dogs. The realm of artificial animal classificaton is entirely untouched from our research so we wanted to try our hand at it. After retaining both  models and prediciting on a various images, we found that our models failed to classify artificial animals correctly. We predict that the domain of all artificial cats or dogs is far too large for a CNN to capture, so it would be best to limit the domain, for example, to only cartoon animals.</p>

<p> We included all of our code and datasets (or links to)in this repository if others wanted to try and experiment with it themselves. We could not include the models because they were too large of a file.</p>

<p> As a small note, this is our first attempt at creating our own models.</p>
